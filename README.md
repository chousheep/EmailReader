This repository is created to help me get familiar with Git and GitHub, while also sharing the GRE Verbal notes I compiled a few years ago. These notes are organized from the perspective of a Chinese-speaking ESL learner. Feel free to use them, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment!
