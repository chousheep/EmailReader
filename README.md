This repository is created to help me get familiar with Git and GitHub (markdown language as well), while also sharing the English-learning notes I compiled a few years ago. These notes are organized from the perspective of a Chinese-speaking ESL learner. Feel free to use them, and if you have any questions or suggestions, you are welcome to leave a comment! 

**Disclaimer:** Most of the example sentences and explanations in these notes were generated using LLMs, then reviewed and refined based on my personal observations as an Chinese-speaking English learner crazily keen on interpretation/translation.
