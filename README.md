# Message 
This repository is created to help me get familiar with Git and GitHub (markdown language as well), while also sharing the English-learning notes I compiled a few years ago. These notes are organized from the perspective of a Chinese-speaking ESL learner. Feel free to use them, and if you have any questions or suggestions, you are more than welcome to leave a comment! 

**Disclaimer:** Most of the example sentences and explanations in these notes were generated using large language models (LLMs), and then reviewed and refined based on my personal observations as a Chinese-speaking English learner with a penchant for interpretation and translation.
